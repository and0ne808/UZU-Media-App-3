# UZU-Media-App-3
Third try of creating a good UZ Media app on github
Upadte: This one worked!

Hey guys this is the repo for our experimental Adobe PhoneGap app.

This is a quick tutorial to get started with PhoneGap development:

http://phonegap.com/getstarted/

we can build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows phone using this system.

THE FILE YOU WANT TO EDIT to modify the app is: platforms/browser/index.html

The file structure is a bit confusing, but you can figure it out if you start at the correct index file
